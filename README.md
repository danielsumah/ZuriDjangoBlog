#Simple Blog App

You can use this app here  https://sumahwrites.herokuapp.com/
        
       - create an account and login to be able to post comments.
        - Login with superuser credentials to be able to create, update and delete posts.

Also, the code for the deployed app is not on the main branch, switch to branch named 'Blog-Version-2' to get working code.

Features of this app:
1. Allows users to view and comment on blog posts
2. Allow the blog creator/super user to interact with the backend as superuser can perform CRUD on frontend from the backend,
3. Prevents the normal users from accessing some views and features accessibles to only superusers.

There are two types of users:

1. Users without an account: You can only read posts
      to be able to comment on posts, you will have to create an account and login
